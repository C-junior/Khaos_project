# Artifact and Rune System Refactor Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Property Access Inconsistencies**
- **Problem**: Mixed usage of `stats.health` vs `health` properties
- **Solution**: Standardized to direct property access (`health`, `max_health`, `attack`)
- **Files Changed**: `CardBase.gd`, `Artifact.gd`, `Data.gd`

### 2. **Missing Status Effect System**
- **Problem**: Status effects like `poison_turns`, `is_frozen`, `shield_active` were referenced but not implemented
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive status effects dictionary and handling methods
- **New Status Effects**:
  - `poison_turns` & `poison_damage`: Poison damage over time
  - `is_frozen`: Skip next turn
  - `attack_delay`: Delay attacks
  - `is_invisible`: Cannot be targeted
  - `attack_boost`: Temporary attack increase
  - `shield_active`: Iron Shield damage reduction
  - `shield`: Damage absorption

### 3. **Artifact System Disconnect**
- **Problem**: CardBase expected `artifact.can_use()` and `artifact.activate()` but Artifact had different methods
- **Solution**: Added `can_use()` method and `activate()` alias to Artifact class
- **Files Changed**: `Artifact.gd`, `CardBase.gd`

### 4. **Incomplete Rune Integration**
- **Problem**: Rune modification system wasn't properly integrated
- **Solution**: Enhanced rune modifier functions and improved integration
- **Files Changed**: `Data.gd`, `Artifact.gd`

### 5. **Missing Status Effect Handling**
- **Problem**: No proper system for applying and managing status effects
- **Solution**: Added `apply_status_effect()`, `apply_poison()`, and `heal()` methods
- **Files Changed**: `CardBase.gd`, `GameManager.gd`

## New Features Added

### 1. **ArtifactFactory System**
- **File**: `ArtifactFactory.gd`
- **Purpose**: Centralized creation and management of artifacts and runes
- **Features**:
  - `create_artifact(name)`: Create artifact instances
  - `create_rune(name)`: Create rune instances
  - `attach_rune_to_artifact()`: Attach runes to artifacts
  - Helper methods for getting available items and info

### 2. **Enhanced Status Effect System**
- **Poison**: Deals damage over multiple turns
- **Freeze**: Skips enemy turns
- **Invisibility**: Prevents targeting
- **Shield Effects**: Multiple types of damage reduction
- **Attack Boosts**: Temporary damage increases

### 3. **Improved Ability Implementations**
All artifact abilities have been rewritten to:
- Use the new status effect system
- Provide better feedback messages
- Handle edge cases properly
- Work with the rune modification system

### 4. **Better Rune Modifiers**
- **Double Trouble**: Now properly finds additional targets
- **Power Boost**: Temporarily increases damage by 50%
- **Quick Cast**: Reduces cooldown (handled in attach_rune)

## Files Modified

### Core System Files
1. **CardBase.gd**: Complete rewrite of status system and property handling
2. **Artifact.gd**: Added missing methods and improved compatibility
3. **Data.gd**: Fixed all artifact abilities and rune modifiers
4. **GameManager.gd**: Enhanced enemy turn logic and status effect handling

### New Files Created
1. **ArtifactFactory.gd**: Factory system for creating artifacts and runes
2. **ArtifactTest.gd**: Test script to verify system functionality
3. **ARTIFACT_RUNE_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive guide for adding new content
4. **REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md**: This summary document

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Factory pattern for object creation
- Comprehensive documentation

### 2. **Extensibility**
- Easy to add new artifacts and runes
- Modular status effect system
- Template patterns for common ability types

### 3. **Robustness**
- Proper error handling
- Edge case management
- Null safety checks

### 4. **User Experience**
- Better feedback messages
- Consistent behavior
- Visual status indicators

## How to Use the New System

### Creating Artifacts
```gdscript
var artifact = ArtifactFactory.create_artifact("Thunder Bolt")
card.artifact = artifact
```

### Attaching Runes
```gdscript
ArtifactFactory.attach_rune_to_artifact(artifact, "Power Boost")
```

### Adding New Artifacts
1. Add data to `Data.artifacts` dictionary
2. Implement ability function in `Data.gd`
3. Add icon asset
4. Test with existing runes

### Adding New Runes
1. Add data to `Data.runes` dictionary
2. Implement modifier function in `Data.gd`
3. Add icon asset
4. Test with existing artifacts

## Testing

The system includes a test script (`ArtifactTest.gd`) that verifies:
- Artifact creation
- Rune creation
- Rune attachment
- All artifacts can be instantiated
- All runes can be instantiated

## Backward Compatibility

The refactor maintains backward compatibility by:
- Keeping original method names as aliases
- Supporting multiple property access patterns
- Graceful handling of missing components

## Performance Considerations

- Status effects are processed efficiently during turns
- Factory methods cache common operations
- Minimal memory overhead for new features

## Future Enhancements

The new system makes it easy to add:
- More complex status effects
- Artifact combinations
- Rune stacking
- Dynamic ability generation
- Visual effect integration
